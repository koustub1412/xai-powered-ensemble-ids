# 🔐 XAI-Powered Ensemble Intrusion Detection System for IoT

## 📌 Overview

The rapid growth of the **Internet of Things (IoT)** has connected billions of smart devices across healthcare, industries, transportation, and smart cities. While this connectivity enhances automation and efficiency, it also significantly increases vulnerability to cyberattacks.

This project presents an **Explainable Ensemble Machine Learning Framework for Intrusion Detection in IoT**, combining:

- 🧠 Stacked Ensemble Learning  
- 🔎 Explainable AI (XAI) using SHAP  
- 🌐 Multi-dataset evaluation  
- 💻 Full-stack deployment (FastAPI + React)  

The system not only detects intrusions but also explains *why* a network instance is classified as malicious.

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):

- ❌ Cannot detect zero-day attacks (signature-based IDS)
- ❌ Produce high false positives (anomaly-based IDS)
- ❌ Lack interpretability (black-box ML models)
- ❌ Suffer from bias–variance issues (single classifiers)

There is a need for a:

✔ Robust  
✔ Accurate  
✔ Explainable  
✔ IoT-compatible  

Intrusion Detection Framework.

## 🧠 Proposed Architecture

### 🔹 Level-1 (Base Learners)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree (DT)
- Logistic Regression (LR)
- Random Forest (RF)

### 🔹 Level-2 (Meta Learner)
- Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)

This **stacking ensemble architecture** improves:

- Detection accuracy  
- Model stability  
- Generalization across datasets  

---

## 🔍 Explainable AI (XAI)

To eliminate black-box behavior, SHAP-based explainability is integrated:

- Feature contribution analysis  
- Human-readable forensic reports  
- Class probability breakdown  
- Risk-level categorization  

The system explains:

- What attack was detected  
- Why it was detected  
- Which features influenced the decision  

---

## 📊 Datasets Used

The system is evaluated on benchmark intrusion datasets:

- **NSL-KDD**
- **ToN-IoT**
- **BoT-IoT**

It also supports CSV upload for custom dataset testing.

---

## 📈 Performance Highlights

The ensemble model achieves:

- ~98%+ Accuracy (NSL-KDD benchmark reference)
- High MCC score
- High F1-score stability
- Low Log Loss
- Reduced false positives

The stacking ensemble outperforms individual ML classifiers.
